#Final project 

> Descriptions of the repository and instructions to build the image and report

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Contents of the repository


### In `code` folder:

`code/01_make_tables.R`

  - read dataset from a .csv file
  - saves data as a `.rds` object in `output/` folder
  - create tabular analysis

`code/02_make_figures.R`

  - load dataset
  - create graphical analysis

`code/03_render_report.R`

  - renders `report.Rmd`
  
### In `data` folder:
`heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv`
   - raw dataset
   
### In `output` folder:
  - figures and tables will be saved here

`project_dataset_report.Rmd`

  - reads tables generated by `code/01_make_tables.R`
  - reads figures generated by `code/02_make_figures.R`
  - makes report with explanations of the results
  - The report basically has two parts: tabular analysis and graphical analysis. From the tabular analysis, we can see that the percentages of hypertension and Anaemia are both higher in elder age group, while such difference is only statistically significant for Anaemia characteristics (p-value<0.05). From the graphical analysis, there is no substantial trend between age and platetes.

## Build docker image

 The link for the image on Docker Hub is https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/monicazhu99/project_image.

  - fork and clone the repository from GitHub link monicazhu/final_project
  - navigate to project directory
  - type `make project_image` in your terminal to build the docker image, it would take some time. Alternatively, you can also type `make pull_image` in your terminal to pull the image from DockerHub.

------------------------------------------------------------------------  

## Generate the final report

Type `make final_report` in your Terminal to generate the final report.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

You can also build the final report in docker container by pulling image from Docker Hub

  - pull image from the DockerHub by typing `docker pull monicazhu99/project_image`
  - generate report by typing `docker run -it monicazhu99/project_image`

My target will build appropriately on Mac/Linux-OS system and windows system.
